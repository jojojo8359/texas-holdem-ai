\section{Introduction}
Texas Hold 'Em is one of the most popular games of poker. It is found at every casino, and most 
individuals who gamble have at least dabbled in the game. However, Texas Hold 'Em, like every other 
game at the casino, is high-risk. It is difficult to learn without losing money, even when playing
online against real people.

This project creates AI agents to play against the human player, allowing people to lean and play poker
without the risk of losing money. Using reinforcement learning, the AI functions as a human, with
the risk of bluffing and playing honorably.

\section{Dataset}
Due to the fact that this project uses reinforcement learning, there is no dataset used. There are 
datasets for Texas Hold 'Em games, but this project did not use any.
